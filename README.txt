This character generator reproduces the typical Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition Character Sheet layout and allows users to randomly generate most key aspects required in character creation via random number generation. Additionally, users can type in their own values or text if desired. The intention of this tool is to allow users to quickly generate a new character for a DnD 5e session, while also incorporating elements from Xanathar's Guide to Everything, an official Wizard of the Coast companion book, to assist in the creation of a backstory.

The application itself is written in C# and uses Windows Forms. It will also support a SQL database for users to store their existing characters in.
